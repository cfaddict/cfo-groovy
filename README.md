# Groovy - Learn Another Language

## About

cf.Objective() is becoming less and less a ColdFusion conference and more an Enterprise Web Development conference. We all know that you can't live on just one tool anymore. We must be eclectic, we must explore new avenues, and learn new things. We all need to become polyglot programmers with several tools in our tool belt. 

We believe that learning another language not only makes you a more versatile programmer but it will also improve your skills in the language you use on a daily basis. When you have a chance to see how another language solves a similar problem it will help you understand the logic behind the solution and not just the syntax.

Groovy is a dynamic language that runs on the Java Virtual Machine (JVM). If that sounds familiar it should, ColdFusion also does that. Groovy gives us all the power of the Java language without all of the headaches and verbosity.  In this session we'll explore Groovy. We will be covering its fundamentals, some of its syntactic sugar and those things that give it its WOW-factor. We will also dive into a few advanced features of the language that really make it, well... Groovy!

This is a deep dive session with two instructors that will last two hours. We will both be presenting but we will also be able to walk around and make sure everyone is able to follow along with us. While we canâ€™t teach you everything about the language in 2 hours we feel that this overview of the language will leave you wanting more.

## Target Audience

Developers looking to challenge themselves and add another tool to their toolbox.

## Prerequisites

Anyone with some programming experience who would like to learn a new language. Experience in any language and an understanding of fundamental programming concepts.
